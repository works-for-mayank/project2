# New Project

THIS project was created from local system
git remote add origin <-link->
git remote -v (to verify remote connection and link)
git branch (to check which branch we are currently on)
git branch -M main (used to rename a branch to "main" or any other name used inside " quotes")
git push origin main (in this the <-link-> is replaced by the main branch)
